I'm fond of data, storytelling, audio and getting people where they need to go.

I work as a freelancer building web-based tools with journalists, investigative journalists and in the broader civic tech space. Along with creating tools I experiment with how the web can enhance storytelling, thinking beyond the article, and the ways in which people consume content.

Until early 2014 I was a [Knight-Mozilla OpenNews](http://opennews.org/fellowships/2013meet.html) fellow at [Zeit Online](http://www.zeit.de), mashing up technology and journalism, sitting inside the Data Journalism team. Before this, inside [the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com), I contributed to the initial CMS revamp, the venturing into microapps and content APIs, and then into the redesign of the workflow and content editing tools.

I [participate](/events) in local and global communities sitting at the intersection between journalism and technology and have been co-organising [Hacks/Hackers in Berlin](meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/) since 2013.

I am passionate about building collaborative teams with alternative leadership styles, creating spaces for people to teach and learn, and fostering acceptance that there are more skills required to build great products than the lines of code you contribute.
