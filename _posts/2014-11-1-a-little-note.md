I'm fond of data, storytelling, audio and getting people where they need to go.

Until earlier this year I was a [Knight-Mozilla OpenNews](http://opennews.org/fellowships/2013meet.html) fellow at [Zeit Online](http://www.zeit.de), mashing up technology and journalism, sitting inside the Data Journalism team. Before this, at [the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com), I witnessed and contributed to the initial CMS revamp, the venture into microapps and content APIs and then into the redesign of the workflow and content editing tools inside the Guardian.

I [build](/projects) tools for journalists, investigative journalists and activists to aid and abet their work. These tools are often short and prototypal, a way of assessing the idea before too much time or money is invested. An incredibly difficult lesson to abide by when you are also invested in an idea.

I [participate](/events) in local and global communities sitting at the intersection between journalism and technology and have been co-organising [Hacks/Hackers in Berlin](meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/) for more than a year.
