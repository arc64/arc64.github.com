So it is the night before the last day that you can apply to be an OpenNews fellow and it may be that you still don't know [why you would apply](http://dansinker.com/post/58361079881/opennews-looking-vs-leaping). Why you should join us on a [ride of a lifetime](http://dansinker.com/post/57449914079/opennews-knight-mozilla-fellowships-what-do-you). Why you (shouldn't be afraid of what happens after)[http://slifty.com/2013/08/opennews-applicants-be-warned/].

There are 8 fellows this year, and 5 alumni and they have all expressed why their experience is unique, and how the OpenNews fellowship has helped them, changed them and blown their minds. 

I am no different. It has changed me, helped me and blown my mind. I think [you should apply](http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/apply.html), and it is not to late. 

If you are a coder in a team seething with passion and an inability to make and create. If you want to break into a community of passionate people at the intersection of technology and journalism. This is the place for you.
