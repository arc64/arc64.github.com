So, tonight is the last night to get your application in. Tomorrow, applications close to become a Knight-Mozilla Fellow in 2014. Maybe you still don't know [why you would apply](http://dansinker.com/post/58361079881/opennews-looking-vs-leaping). Why you should join us on a [ride of a lifetime](http://dansinker.com/post/57449914079/opennews-knight-mozilla-fellowships-what-do-you). Why you [shouldn't be afraid of what happens after](http://slifty.com/2013/08/opennews-applicants-be-warned/).

<!-- There are 8 fellows this year, and 5 alumni and they have all expressed why their experience is unique, and how the OpenNews fellowship has helped them, changed them and blown their minds.

I spent a few days at [OHM](https://ohm2013.org/site/) a few weeks ago, sleeping in a tent and being woken by the sun at an absurd time after listening to the heavy beats of [Breakcore](http://www.last.fm/tag/breakcore) late into the night. Fibre was laid into the ground, and access points dressed as Data Toilets - provided internet out to the distant trees. People hacked on hardware, software, locks, rings, beer and ham and cheese toasties.

In that field I hacked too, and when OHM was over I went home to Berlin to hack. The fellowship has allowed me the privilege of meeting those who are in this community from all over the world, to observe, hack and make journalism as a part of this ever growing community, regardless of which field they are sitting in.

My fellowship feels a bit like an extended OHM, a summer camp, surrounded by a tightknit community in a world that seems completely unlike real life. I think [you should apply](http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/apply.html) and join the community. It is not to late. 

If you are a coder in a team seething with passion and an ability to make and create. If you want a year free to see inside a newsroom and hack on journalism. If you want to break into a community of passionate people at the intersection of technology and journalism. [This is the place for you](http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/apply.html). 

<p><small>* Nearly a year.</small></p>
