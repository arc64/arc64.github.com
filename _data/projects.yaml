- projects: Data stringers
  title: <strong>Data stringers</strong> when a project fails do a workshop.
  description: |
    It turns out the Datawi.re didn't really live up to our expectations,
    and a model of consuming many data was too broad for the journalism use cases we wanted to solve.
    I ran data stringers workshops at Mozfest and Hacks/Hackers.
    One of the lovely outcomes of this was that
    <a href="https://twitter.com/basilesimon">Basile Simon</a> created a real live <a href="https://github.com/BBC-News-Labs/datastringer">Datastringer</a>.

    questions on their own articles with Vine, and to have commenters respond in kind. The hope would be
